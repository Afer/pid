								<p>
									A regular website is usually designed for viewing on a desktop computer.
									When viewed on a mobile device, the user experience isn't great.
									Buttons and text are smaller, navigating the site involves pinching and zooming the screen,
									and some elements might not work at all. A mobile-optimized site solves
									this problem by having thumb-friendly buttons and access to contact information
									and directions in just one click.
